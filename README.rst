dbBact Qiita Plugin
===================

|Build Status| |Coverage Status|

Qiita (canonically pronounced *cheetah*) is an analysis environment for microbiome (and other "comparative -omics") datasets.

This package includes the dbBact functionality for Qiita.

Note that this repository contains two plugins, namely `qtp-wordcloud` for a new Artifact type definition and `qp-dbbact` for the artifact transformation action.
